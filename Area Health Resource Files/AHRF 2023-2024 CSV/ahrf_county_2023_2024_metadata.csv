Under the standards, the county (or counties) in which at least 50 percent of the population resides within urban areas of 10,000 or more population, or contain at least 5,000 people residing within a single urban area of 10,000 or more population, is identified as a “central county” (counties).

combnd_stat_area_23,"Combined Statistical Area Code based on 2023 data. If specified criteria are met, adjacent Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas, in various combinations, may become the components of a set of complementary areas called Combined Statistical Areas.  For instance, a Combined Statistical Area may comprise two or more Metropolitan Statistical Areas, a Metropolitan Statistical Area and a Micropolitan Statistical Area, two or more Micropolitan Statistical Areas, or multiple Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas that have social and economic ties as measured by commuting, but at lower levels then are found among counties with Metropolitan and Micropolitan Areas. Combined Statistical Areas can be characterized as representing larger regions that reflect broader social and economic interactions, such as wholesaling, commodity distribution, and weekend recreation activities, and are likely to be of considerable interest to regional authorities and the private sector.  Because Combined Statistical Areas represent groupings of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas (in any combination), they should not be ranked or combined with the individual Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas."

urban_influnc_13,"2013 Urban Influence Codes are from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service (ERS) website: http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes.aspx. The 2013 Urban Influence Codes form a classification scheme that distinguishes metropolitan (metro) counties by population size of their metro area, and nonmetropolitan (nonmetro) counties by size of the largest city or town and proximity to metropolitan and micropolitan areas. The standard Office of Management and Budget (OMB) metro and nonmetro categories have been subdivided into two metro and 10 nonmetro categories, resulting in a 12-part county classification.  "
